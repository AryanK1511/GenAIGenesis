# Google Cloud Setup

I am documenting all the steps that I took to configure Google Cloud.

First, I installed the `gcloud` CLI and initialized it.

**You can do this in two ways:**

1. Using the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk).
2. Using [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/google-cloud-sdk).

Here is a link to the full official Google Cloud Documentation:

Next, I went to the Cloud console to enable the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs) and generated a key for credentials.
